# Smart home automation using Arduino

This code controls two switches(via relays) using a bluetooth module.

Parts required to build this project

1.Arduino Uno

2.HC05 Bluetooth Module

3.Jumper cables/wires

4.Relay switch

5.Some food and cold drinks(LOL)

Basically the program sents a 'A' or 'B' to indicate its Power On or High state and 'a' or 'b' to indicate its power off or low state.

You will need to install a android app on your mobile. Install from here- <b>https://iop.li/Wkw</b>
